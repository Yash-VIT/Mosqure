### SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION
The Aedes genus of mosquitoes is the key vector for headline-grabbing diseases such as
Zika, Dengue, and Yellow Fever. Dengue alone causes 100 million illnesses annually, mostly
in developing countries. Because Aedes mosquitoes are sensitive to environmental factors
-- including temperature, humidity, rainfall, elevation, and urban extent -- it is possible to
anticipate when and where they will be abundant and active, and to issue advisories to the
public and/or health emergency practitioners (as is currently done for heat waves, floods,
etc.). The key is that advisories need to be a) accurate and dependable; b) user-friendly,
c) locale-specific (e.g., within a 100 km radius), d) calibrated to useful time scales for
action (eg. less than 12 months). Such capability could be integrated into global effo
to combat mosquitoâ€”borne disease.

Our Solution:
Our Team Cosmos derived an innovative solution wherein we 
1. Predicted total number of cases possible for the 3 diseases in and around Bangalore,India denoted by Hotsposts,
   where the Intensity of Hotspot indicated the amount. So,more the intensity more the infected.

2. Predictions were made for a period of 12 months which provides Government, sufficient time to take measures.

3. Interactive front-end which includes easy-to-use functionalities and help-line numbers

4. Chatbot integrated with front-end for quicker determination of whether a person maybe infected or not.

5. Most Unique feature, where we used an optimization algorithm to allocate each Hotspot to a nearest distribution centre based on infections and load balance.

6. Classified Twitter data for effective information about places which are infected.
